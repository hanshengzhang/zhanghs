title: Six lessons learned on building data pipelines
---

I have built many data pipelines since I started my career in 2015.
When preparing a talk on building data marts in 2017, I added a "lessons learned" list to the slides.
The list has been adjusted based on my later experiences of building more data pipelines and mentoring junior members.

I May

# Lesson 1: Fail as early as possible (2017)


- use static typed language.
- write unit test.
- write integration test.
- write scala codes when you know how they are compiled to Java.


# Lesson 2: Magic is trouble (2017)


A bound it is possible. Beyond that bound.

# Lesson 3: Design the states (2018)

Essential. idempotence.

# Lesson 4: Validate the assumptions (2018)



# Lesson 5: Make the component act correctly (2019)

# Lesson 6: Implement two-stage compatibility (2019)
